This specialization consider the basic topics of machine learning, which are necessary in working with a large array of data, including basic fundamental mathematics, Python programming, modern methods of classification and regression, search of structure in data, conducting experiments, writing conclusions.

The course explains how to build a recommendation system, assess the emotional coloring of the text, predict the demand for a product, estimate the probability of clicking on ads, etc.

A prediction model was built in the final project (course 6). The model predicts the churn of a telecom company's users with an accuracy of 70% (ROC-AUC).
