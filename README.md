This specialization consider the basic topics of machine learning, which are necessary in working with a large array of data, including basic fundamental mathematics, Python programming, modern methods of classification and regression, search of structure in data, conducting experiments, writing conclusions.

The course explains how to build a recommendation system, assess the emotional coloring of the text, predict the demand for a product, estimate the probability of clicking on ads, etc.

In the final, a project to predict the outflow of users of a telecom company was implemented. The result was a working model that allows predicting user outflow with an accuracy of 70% (ROC-AUC).
